# Work Values

I was recently working on a classical company values exercise. And realized
that I am repeating very similar things as in the previous companies (which is
a good thing, I guess). Thus decided to write it down for the future use.

I like to work at a remote-first organization. That doesn't mean being fully
remote, on the contrary. The key goal of a remote-first organization is to
deliberately develop communication channels. Mainly to allow seamless
collaboration among people being remote and being in the office.

The following text was written as addressing the company/team. Please, excuse
a bit deliberate use of the pronoun `you` :)

## Transparency and Openness

Working and helping others is a priority, even if you don't see a direct
relationship to the goals that you are trying to achieve. Anyone can chime in on
any subject. The fact that somebody is part of a particular team doesn't mean
that they cannot provide view, help, or suggestions. Those who are responsible
for the work decides how to do it. They should always take each suggestion
seriously and try to respond and explain why it may or may not have been
implemented.

### Transparency

We **default to transparency**, meaning that we should make everything
accessible by default and only solve for limited access rights in special cases.
Place files in shared drives (Team Google Drive for example). There is no
doubt that one would share an access to document when asked. That's too late though
(for example, such a document would not be discoverable via search). Capture the
progress in appropriate tickets.

Such a level of openness / sharing can be counter-intuitive for new team
members. Invest an extra time into explaining why we are trying to exercise extreme
transparency. Engage in open dialogue. Walk the extra mile to allow sharing.

A great example is making private issues, postmortems or Slack channels
public. So, we all can learn from them.

### Openness

Being **open** and **honest** with each other is a very critical component of our
success. Nobody knows everything. Be open for other ideas and views.

Our favorite mantra is -- **"strong opinions, loosely held"**. We have opinions,
but we are ready and willing to change them. Especially, when a better solution
is proposed or view is proposed by somebody else. We are not about ego, but
about the common goal.

Most learning and progress is hidden in our failures -- foster them and make
sure, that all postmortems are
[blameless](https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/blameless-postmortems/). We have to
make sure, that we maintain a safe harbor for everybody, and otherwise we may be
missing an important voice.

## WHY? WHY? WHY? and maybe WHAT? and HOW?

Always try asking yourself **why** [multiple
times](https://www.inc.com/jason-surfrapp/the-theory-of-the-3-whys.html). The
number loved by many is 3, but do not hesitate to ask 5 times or just twice.
Anything what is appropriate.

When writing a request (ticket, Slack message, email...) try to provide complete
context -- **why**, **what** and then (maybe) **how**. Either skip the "how"
completely or make it just a suggestion to allow the responsible person to come
up with the best solution.

## Fairness and Honesty

Be _always_ fair to each other. Expect that others are not trying to cause harm.
Always make your best to evaluate people accurately. That doesn't mean being
dishonest, or unnecessarily politically correct.

### Say thanks

Don't forget to give credit where credit is due. But just "thank you" in
a company/team-wide channel will do a lot.

### Say sorry

If you've made a mistake, apologize. Apologizing is not a sign of weakness, but
one of strength. The people who are active inevitably make mistakes. When
we share our mistakes and bring attention to them, others can learn from us. The
same mistake is less likely to be repeated by someone else.

This concept extends to postmortems, as we have mentioned above. Always have
a ticket(s) tracking issue(s) and their resolution, as well as write down
postmortem. Especially for high-profile emergencies (such as downtime of
production systems).

### Assume positive intent

Always keep in mind, that we frequently fall victim to the [fundamental
attribution error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error).
In a nutshell -- we blame circumstances for our own mistakes, but others for
theirs. To fight this urge, we should always [assume positive
intent](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/assuming-positive-intent-the-ultimate-productivity-driver.html)
in interactions with others. Especially when this interaction happens over
electronic channels (email, chat).

### Providing feedback

Providing feedback is not an easy thing. Receiving feedback is even more
challenging.

When providing feedback, always focus on the work itself, emphasis
business or technical impact, never the person. Make sure that you provide at
least one recent and clear example. Try to factor in external factors (maybe
parson is going through some family crisis, for example).

Every feedback we give needs to be **constructive**. Feedback can be delivered
and received in a positive or negative way. Make an extra effort to deliver feedback
kindly. And receive feedback with the open mind.

Nobody has 100% delivery, consider if the particular issue is even worth
providing feedback. Especially, if one is in a position of power (e.g.
a manager). Negative events are typically taken [way more (6x)
seriously](https://hbr.org/2013/03/the-delicate-art-of-giving-fee) than positive
ones.

Being direct means to be transparent with each other. It doesn't mean being
mean. We strive to be a bit like Ben Horowitz, as they call him, being [both
straightforward and
kind](https://blog.producthunt.com/ben-horowitz-s-best-startup-advice-7e8c09c8de1b).

### Get to know each other

We are spread all around the World and also use a lot of text-based
communication tools (email, chat, tickets). We don't have the "luxury" of being
able to meet everybody in person, go together to lunch. Thus, it is essential to
engage in activities which supplement random and more casual interactions.

## Delivery

We care about getting rid of work which can be replaced with automation as well
as we try to avoid duplication. [Amazon states it best]
(http://www.amazon.jobs/principles)with:

> Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

### Measure results, not time

We care about delivery and achievement. Not if one spends 12 hours at the
office. You don’t need to defend how you spend your day. Everybody is most
productive at different times.

Frequently, we all spend more hours, working at night, or a weekend. But we do it
because we are passionate about what we do. On the other side, if you are
working constantly for too many hours, talk to your manager to find solutions.

### Do it yourself

We love to collaborate -- help each other when with questions, seeking for
critique, or need help. All to allow everybody to deliver whatever they are
working on. There is no need to brainstorm every single thing, or wait for
consensus, or [do with two what you can do
yourself](https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/collaboration-is-the-enemy-of-innovation.html).

Every so often, it is time to call multiple people in to weight different
options, and make a strategic level decision. But we want to avoid [analysis
paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis). Decisions should
be thoughtful, but delivering fast means that we can make mistakes. We should
not fear them, but be ready to fix them quickly. That may inform our future
design decisions (for example, prefer modularized design instead of monolith).

### Ownership

We expect everybody to own what they are doing. Owning the work, means that you
are responsible for that particular piece to be moved forward. Be proactive in
informing stakeholders when there is something you need help with, you cannot
solve on your own. Don't just sit on tasks.

### Keep the bigger picture in mind

When making decisions, always keep the bigger picture in mind. Optimize for the
whole company, not only for your team or yourself.

For example, if fulfilling your goal has a negative impact on somebody else
(other colleagues; team; company, or customers), you should raise the flag as
such goal is probably incorrect.

Help others to achieve their goals. You are blocking somebody (for example, they
are waiting for decision, merge request review) your top priority should be to
unblock them. Unblocking can also mean that you help them to find a more
appropriate person to handle the request (aka delegate).

### Respect others' time

Always try to be on time. People waiting for each other are basically just
wasting their time.

Avoid unnecessary meetings. Don’t use meetings to get permission, use it to get
opinions, suggestions, fresh ideas. When is meeting necessary always:

- try to make attendance optional for as many people as possible;
- try to have meeting agenda linked from your meeting invite;
- document the outcome (meeting minutes, ticket(s)).

If you want resolution from somebody, think about using [written narratives](/written-narratives).
Actually, every interaction should be treated as a narrative -- provide context
for the question, make sure, that people understand your point.

Think about multiplication effects, when sending one-to-many communication (like emails). If one needs 10 minutes to read that email, and it has 15 recipients, we might just burned 150 minutes. Try to provide a summary (famous [TL;DR](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-tldr-2483633)) at the beginning of a longer text.

### Responsibility over Rigidity

We believe that it is better to give people freedom and responsibility to make
decisions and hold them accountable for that. Instead of imposing complicated
rules and rigid approval processes.

Most decisions are easy to reverse. There is a helpful [metaphor attributed to
Amazon](https://www.geekwire.com/2015/the-peculiar-traits-of-great-amazon-leaders-frugal-innovative-and-body-odor-that-doesnt-smell-like-perfume/)
about one-way and two-way door decisions. Make reversible changes without
approval. And if they are not reversible (or they are hard to), then we should
have more through discussion about them.

## Diversity

Diversity is a critical asset. Having people from different countries and
cultural backgrounds gives us tremendous advantage in finding alternative
solutions and new market opportunities. We don't select candidates because we'd
like to go partying with them. We hire and reward employees based on our shared
values, as described on this page. Values fit is the important piece, not
a culture fit. We actually want to avoid everybody behaves according to one
culture, especially if such cultures are not inclusive. For example, [a
brogrammer culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brogrammer).

Unexpected and unconventional things make life more interesting. Talk about
hobbies and passions. Share pictures of weekend projects. Send us
a postcard from your travels. Coffee breaks and Donut/S'Up calls are an
excellent place to share those.
