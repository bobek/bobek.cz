## Elixir

- [Modern Talking with Elixir: Build a Messenger App with Phoenix LiveView](https://curiosum.dev/blog/elixir-phoenix-liveview-messenger-part-1)

    Very promising first part of series about Phoenix LiveView. This part only scratches the surface of LiveView with promise of covering building complete application from start to finish.

## Rust

- [Ownership and impl Trait](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/rust/ownership-and-impl-trait)

    Article focuses on gotchas when using `impl Trait` in Rust. `impl Trait` is very useful for making code easier to read. Author takes us through impact of implicit lifetime when using `impl Trait` and how to work around them.

## Machine learning

- Two interesting papers from the optimization space trying to bring optimality guarantees given the constraints fed to them:

  - [Optimized Risk Scores](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/papers/view/optimized-risk-scores)

        Slightly older paper describing `RiskSLIM` algorithm, which produces risk score with proof of optimality. They introduce the latice cutting plane algorithm (LCPA) in order to avoid the stalling behavior for non-convex settings of existing cutting plane algorithms. Sources are also [available](https://github.com/ustunb/risk-slim).

  - [Learning Certifiably Optimal Rule Lists for Categorical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01701)

        > CORELS (**C**ertifiable **O**ptimal **R**ul**E** **L**ist**S**) is a custom discrete optimization technique for building rule lists over a categorical feature space. Our algorithm provides the optimal solution, with a certificate of optimality.

        That is potentially very important for decision trees used in fintech or other areas having direct impact on humans. Source codes have been made [available](https://github.com/nlarusstone/corels).

- [DeepPavlov](http://deeppavlov.ai/)

    Open source (Keras and TensorFlow based) project for building conversationals chatbots.

## Learning

- [Quantum supremacy: the gloves are off](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4372)

    FAQ style writeup from Scott Aaronson (author of "Quantum Computing since Democritus") about Google reaching quantum supremacy.

## Interesting tools

- [`pg_flame`](https://github.com/mgartner/pg_flame)

    A flamegraph generator for Postgres EXPLAIN ANALYZE output.
