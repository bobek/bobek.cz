## Elixir

- [How to use data spanning multiple data sources in Elixir](https://medium.com/rekkiapp/how-to-use-data-spanning-multiple-data-sources-in-elixir-50f39c87d8fc)

    Excellent write up about solving non-trivial data fetching problem with Ecto's [preload functions](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.html#preload/3-preload-functions).

- [Functional lessons learnt](https://8thlight.com/blog/javier-garc%C3%ADa/2019/10/29/functional-lessons.html)

    Couple of hints from Javier's journey to functional programming.

## Machine Learning

- [The Data School Library](https://dataschool.com/books/)

    Set of free and open books around data. Especially interesting as material to share with people starting their data carrier.

- Loan risk analysis

    Nice series of articles describing potential ML pipeline for assessing loan risk scoring. It is written by Databricks for their platform, but quite applicable without it as well.
