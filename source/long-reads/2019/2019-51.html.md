This may easily be the last one for this year. Thank you everybody for you support, wish you a great holidays and see you in an amazing year 2020.

## Just interesting stuff

- [The #1 bug predictor is not technical, it's organizational complexity](https://augustl.com/blog/2019/best_bug_predictor_is_organizational_complexity/)

    Article summarizes findings of Miscrosoft Reasearch, after the unsuccessful launch of Windows Vista in 2007. Original full report is available at the [Miscrosoft's site](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-influence-of-organizational-structure-on-software-quality-an-empirical-case-study/). As title spoiled, the main predictor is not technical complexity, but company culture and setup.

- [Anki, Jibo, and Kuri: What We Can Learn from Social Robots That Didn't Make It](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/home-robots/anki-jibo-and-kuri-what-we-can-learn-from-social-robotics-failures)

    I am not building a social robot, but those findings are primarily about human interactions after all. So these failures are an interesting for human-to-human interactions (especially when they are remote).

- [Interactive Core Memory Shield Using LED Matrix](https://hackaday.io/project/163976-interactive-core-memory-shield-using-led-matrix)

    This project is just a beautiful teaching tool, if you find yourself in need of explaining how core memory works.

- [TMAI #192: The Perfect Rose Bush Distraction](https://madmimi.com/p/6754cf)

    This week's write from Avinash Kaushik is excellent. He talks about rose bush culture, which is basically about not paying attention to the bigger and more important picture.

## Machine Learning

- [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

    Classical book from MIT Press by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville released as a free web book.

- [Decoding the Best Machine Learning Papers from NeurIPS 2019](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/12/neurips-2019-best-papers/)

    - Distribution-Independent PAC Learning of Halfspaces with Massart Noise
    - Nonparametric Density Estimation & Convergence Rates for GANs under Besov IPM Losses
    - Fast and Accurate Least-Mean-Squares Solvers
    - Uniform convergence may be unable to explain generalization in Deep Learning
    - Putting An End to End-to-End: Gradient-Isolated Learning of Representations
    - Scene Representation Networks: Continuous 3D-Structure-Aware Neural Scene Representations
    - Dual Averaging Method for Regularized Stochastic Learning and Online Optimization

- [Future of Data Engineering](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/data-engineering-pipelines-warehouses/)

    Talk goes through 6 stages of building a working data engineering platform. Chris Riccomini from WePay shows how are also data platforms shifting from monoliths into microservices / distributed architectures.

- [Pretraining BERT with Layer-wise Adaptive Learning Rates](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/pretraining-bert-with-layer-wise-adaptive-learning-rates/)

    Article also includes example implementation of LAMB (called NVLAMB) in their BERT repositories. One based on [PyTorch](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/LanguageModeling/BERT) and the other one on [TensorFlow](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/TensorFlow/LanguageModeling/BERT).

- [Accelerate OpenCV: Optical Flow Algorithms with NVIDIA Turing GPUs](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/opencv-optical-flow-algorithms-with-nvidia-turing-gpus/)

    NVIDIA has released hw accelerated [OpticalFlow SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/opticalflow-sdk) and it's integration with [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/master/dc/d9d/classcv_1_1cuda_1_1NvidiaOpticalFlow__1__0.html).

## Building Software

- [Idiomatic Rust](https://github.com/mre/idiomatic-rust)

    A peer-reviewed collection of articles/talks/repos which helps you to write elegant Rust programs.

- [Elixir Boilerplate](https://github.com/mirego/elixir-boilerplate)

    The project template which is used at Mirego to build Phoenix projects. In has full GraphQL, gettext and code-quality setup. Definitely a lot of inspiration for our own projects there.

- [Elixir Styleguide](https://github.com/christopheradams/elixir_style_guide)

    A community drive style guide for Elixir.

## Infrastructure

- [PostgreSQL at low level: stay curious!](https://erthalion.info/2019/12/06/postgresql-stay-curious/)

    Article describes ways how to observe (yeah some BPF greatness there as well) some of the low-level behavior of PostgreSQL.

- [Building a Kubernetes Platform at Pinterest](https://stackshare.io/pinterest/building-a-kubernetes-platform-at-pinterest)

    Notes from Pinterest Kubernetes team about their experience of scaling k8s for their production.

- [BeyondProd: How Google moved from perimeter-based to cloud-native security](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/beyondprod-whitepaper-discusses-cloud-native-security-at-google)

    Article is, unfortunately, not very detailed. But provides links to key projects you should consider when trying to adopt BeyondProd. BeyondProd is set of the following security principles:

    - Protection of the network at the edge
    - No inherent mutual trust between services
    - Trusted machines running code with known provenance
    - Choke points for consistent policy enforcement across services, for example, ensuring authorized data access
    - Simple, automated, and standardized change rollout, and
    - Isolation between workloads
