## Elixir

- [Ecto Tips: UUID Boilerplate, Docs, and Composing Changesets](https://bernheisel.com/blog/ecto_changeset_tips/)

    Excellent write-up touching making UUID first-class citizen as your DB IDs (do you use UUID as id, right?) and also couple great tips on documenting and allowing composition of Ecto changesets.

- [Generate API Documentation Effortlessly from your Phoenix/Elixir code - Part1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/generate-api-documentation-effortlessly-from-your-code-vladim%25C3%25ADr-gorej/)

    First part, of the 3 part series, shows how to annotate your Phoenix code to allow export of `swagger` specification. It leverages `PhoenixSwagger`, which currently supports version 2 of the OpenAPI Specification (while v3 is the current one). Cannot wait for the rest.

- [Building Hex Diff](https://blog.jola.dev/building-hex-diff)

    Johanna provides an introduction to newly released [Hex Diff](https://diff.hex.pm/). It is [fully open-sourced](https://github.com/hexpm/diff), so you can study the code to learn new tricks.

## Infrastructure

- [kubelabs](https://github.com/collabnix/kubelabs)

    Set of hands-on exercises / labs to get you started with Kubernetes.

## General

- [Bring your monorepo down to size with sparse-checkout](https://github.blog/2020-01-17-bring-your-monorepo-down-to-size-with-sparse-checkout/)

    Git version `2.25.0` introduces better support for sparse checkouts. You can use `git sparse-checkout` to select subdirectories of your interest from the huge repo. This was objectively the only thing I've ever missed when switched from subversion many years ago.
