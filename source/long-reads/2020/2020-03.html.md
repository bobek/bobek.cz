## Elixir

- [Real-time Object Detection with Phoenix and Python](https://www.poeticoding.com/real-time-object-detection-with-phoenix-and-python/)

    Very comprehensive post about using [Ports](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Port.html) for interconnecting Elixir with applications written in different languages.

- [Riak Core on Partisan on Elixir Tutorial: Introduction](http://marianoguerra.org/posts/riak-core-on-partisan-on-elixir-tutorial-introduction.html)

    Series of articles about distributed programming with Partisan (which is alternative to distribute Erlang which doesn't need full mesh).

- [Easy and Robust Rate Limiting In Elixir](https://akoutmos.com/post/rate-limiting-with-genservers/)

    Implementation of leaky and token bucket based rate limiters in Elixir. It is using `GenServer`, so there is potentially bottleneck (while it is probably reasonably high as it delegates most of the work to a separate process).

- [Using Maps in Typespecs](http://crevalle.io/maps-in-typespecs.html)

    Short but pretty useful article as `Maps` in `typespecs` are something not really obvious.

## Machine Learning

- [Introducing Flyte: A Cloud Native Machine Learning and Data Processing Platform](https://eng.lyft.com/introducing-flyte-cloud-native-machine-learning-and-data-processing-platform-fb2bb3046a59)

    Lyft has opensourced their platform for managing data processing workflows. Also check out [hackers news thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21982836) for comparison with Airflow.

## Infrastructure

- [Big Prometheus](https://monitoring2.substack.com/p/big-prometheus)

    Overview of available projects to scale up your Prometheus.

- [NATS JetStream](https://github.com/nats-io/jetstream)

    NATS team has released a tech preview of JetStream, their persistence engine that will support streaming as well as traditional message and worker queues for At-Least-Once delivery semantics.

- [SRE: Observability: Metric Namespaces and Structures](https://medium.com/dm03514-tech-blog/sre-observability-metric-namespaces-and-structures-12ffcf5a5bdc)

    Naming is arguably the hardest problem in Computer Science. Article advocates good practices in naming and defining hierarchies within your metrics.

## General

- [Ten simple rules for structuring papers](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/088278v5)

    Good suggestions for structuring your scientific paper. Well applicable to any technical writing.

- [Atomic lock-free counters in Python](https://julien.danjou.info/atomic-lock-free-counters-in-python/)

    Author leverages Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) and `itertools.count` to implement fast thread-safe counter without explicit locking.
