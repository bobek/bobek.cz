## Elixir

    Basically sagas within your application. If you are interested in the actual sagas for distributed computing, check excellent [Introducing Sage â€” a Sagas pattern implementation in Elixir](https://medium.com/nebo-15/introducing-sage-a-sagas-pattern-implementation-in-elixir-3ad499f236f6).

- [Elixir: What about tests?](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2020/01/elixir-what-about-tests/)

    Overview of `Bypass` and `Mox` for mocking API responses in your Elixir tests.

- [RTypes Data Generators](https://pl-rants.net/posts/rtypes-data-generators/)

## Go

- [eris: a better way to handle, trace, and log errors in Go](https://github.com/rotisserie/eris)

    Basic error wrapping was added in Go 1.13, but it omitted user-friendly `Wrap` methods and built-in stack tracing. Other error packages provide some of the features found in `eris` but without flexible control over error output formatting. This package provides default string and JSON formatters with options to control things like separators and stack trace output.
