Written standup is a frequently overlooked tool for distributed teams. It allows people, who for any reason missed a particular standup, to catch up easily. It also produces a body of searchable and rich documents. It helps you to see what you have achieved during the day, and get a sense of accomplishment, which is otherwise challenging to get at knowledge jobs. Best is to treat written standup as your logbook. Filling it during the day removes burden of remembering what you have done at the end of the day. As well as it allows for faster pickup by others.

Here are some of the benefits of written standup:

- **Increased visibility:** Written standup gives everyone on the team visibility into what everyone else is working on. This helps to keep everyone aligned and working towards the same goals.
- **Improved accountability:** Written standup helps to improve accountability by making it clear what everyone is supposed to be working on. This helps to ensure that everyone is pulling their weight and contributing to the team's success.
- **Improved communication:** Written standup helps to improve communication by providing a forum for team members to share updates and ask questions. This helps to keep everyone in the loop and prevents misunderstandings from happening.

If you are a distributed team, I highly recommend using written standup. It is a simple tool that can have a big impact on your team's productivity and effectiveness.

## How to Do Written Standup

Written standup is a simple process. Here are the steps involved:

1. Simple automation creates a fresh standup document during the night.
1. At the beginning of each day, each team member writes a short update about what they plan to work on that day.
1. The updates are then shared with the rest of the team.
1. At the end of the day, each team member writes a short update about what they actually worked on and what they plan to work on the next day.

That's it! Written standup is a simple process that can have a big impact on your team's productivity and effectiveness.
