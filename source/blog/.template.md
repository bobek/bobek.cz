Here are some blogging tips:

1. You should blog. Even if nobody reads them, you should write them.
2. If you want people to read your blog, be yourself. You can’t please everybody, so focus on making yourself happy.
3. Blog just for one person. Blog like you’re talking to them. Don’t worry about if other people will read it.
4. Be honest.
5. Don’t be narcissistic. Be humble.
6. Sometimes, the best blogs to write about are common knowledge to you. Because of the nature of a blog, if people read it, they will read it exactly when the time is right for them.
